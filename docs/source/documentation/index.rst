Documentation
=============

*Hyper-Shell* is to some extent self documenting.

Executing any of the top-level
commands without arguments will print a basic usage statement. Passing the ``--help``
option to any top-level command will print a full help listing.

You can view much of the same documentation provided here directly from the command
line by viewing the manual page,

.. code-block:: none

    âžœ man hyper-shell

|

Networking and logging options are consistent between all three commands.
