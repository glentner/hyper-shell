-k, --auth *KEY*
    Cryptographic key for connection (default: *__HYPERSHELL__BAD__AUTHKEY__*).
    This is set by the server and required for clients to connect.
    The default is intentionally meant to suggest you set something more appropriate.
    In *cluster* mode, a 512-bit hex-token is autogenerated if none is explicitly provided.

    Set configuration value ``server.key`` or an environment variable
    ``HYPERSHELL_SERVER_KEY``.
