Many open-source projects are released under the
`GNU Public License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_, or something similar.
There is a lot of confusion among industry practitioners with regard to open-source software
licenses and their restrictions. Nevertheless, we feel that the more permissive Apache license
is better suited for this particular project and its goals.

Under the Apache Software License, anyone is free to use `HyperShell` as part
of any proprietary, closed-source project. That's a good thing!
